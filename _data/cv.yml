- title: Work with me
  contents:  I am a doctoral student with a specialization in designing experiments for human multi-robot system interaction. My research focuses on enabling a single human operator to efficiently monitor and collaborate with multiple intelligent robots in dynamically changing, extreme environments. I bridge the worlds of robotics, machine learning, and UX design to enhance human multi-robot teaming. With extensive experience in Python, data science, and open-source AI libraries, I'm well-equipped to design innovative robotics solutions for a wide variety of industrial applications.
