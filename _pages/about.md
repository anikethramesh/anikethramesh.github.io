Teams of the future will consist of robots and humans. My research explores how to best achieve synergy in such teams. More specifically, I design experiments to understand how human-multirobot teams work in practice, especially when the robots are capable of different behaviours. This requires careful examination of human and robot capabilities, their limitations and how different interaction design choices can affect them. My research is highly interdisciplinary, combining insights from fields like swarm intelligence, robotics, machine learning, UX design, theory of mind, and psychology. Currently my work is focused on applying the 'Robot Vitals and Robot Health' framework to robotic missions in extreme environments.

When I'm not in my lab, I write boastful website bios hoping to impress a future research prospect. I also fiddle with my musical instruments (which my flatmates arenâ€™t very fond of), philosophize everything, stack random facts about random things and practice the art of making bad jokes.
