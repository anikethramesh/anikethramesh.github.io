It is my pleasure to let you all know I am part of the program committee for the [VAT4HRT Workshop](https://vat-hri-2023.cs.umu.se/).

My paper [Robot Health Indicator: A Visual Cue to Improve Level of Autonomy Switching Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06776.pdf) will also be presented in this workshop.

Here's the abstract of the paper

***
Using different Levels of Autonomy (LoA), a human operator can
vary the extent of control they have over a robot’s actions. LoAs
enable operators to mitigate a robot’s performance degradation
or limitations in the its autonomous capabilities. However, LoA
regulation and other tasks may often overload an operator’s cogni-
tive abilities. Inspired by video game user interfaces, we study if
adding a ‘Robot Health Bar’ to the robot control UI can reduce the
cognitive demand and perceptual effort required for LoA regulation
while promoting trust and transparency. This Health Bar uses the
robot vitals and robot health framework to quantify and present
runtime performance degradation in robots. Results from our pi-
lot study indicate that when using a health bar, operators used to
manual control more to minimise the risk of robot failure during
high performance degradation. It also gave us insights and lessons
to inform subsequent experiments on human-robot teaming.

See you all at HRI. Fair warning though - I look better in my photos than in reality, so you may have a tough time finding me.
